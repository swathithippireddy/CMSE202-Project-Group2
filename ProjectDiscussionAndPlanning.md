1. What form of communication will work best for all of your when you need to discuss your project and make decisions? For example, will you use Slack, Discord, text messages, email, in-person meetings etc.?


We will use a Slack as our primary means of communication. Each of us will udpate the rest of group on tasks we are working on and what we will be working on to ensure a smooth process.


2. How often do you think you should meet as a group to discuss your project? How long should these meetings be? What should you do if you can't make a meeting?


We will try to meet at least once or twice a week. These meetings may be up to an hour each. If a member cannot make a meeting, they are responsible for following up witht he rest of the group to make sure they get all the details that was discussed. The member is also expected to let the group know prior to meeting that he/she will not be able to make it. 


3. What are some strategies you can use to make sure everyone is contributing to the project? How will you make sure everyone is on the same page? How will you hold each other accountable?


During weekly meetings, we can create tasks for everyone to ensure each member has a task to work on and will be able to complete it by the time we meet again. This is one way to check the progress of everyone's tasks and also make sure everyone is contrubiting almost equally. 


4. As a group, what are you overall goals for the project? What strategies will you use to make sure you meet these goals?
- Making sure we can complete the full project in time.
- Our model/project should be accurate as much as possible.
